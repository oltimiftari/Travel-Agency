# Travel Agency - Project
JO-NA Travel Agency

The TravelAgency module was created to ensure efficiency and reliability in managing travel-related services. It handles user reservations, flight data, and payment processes to provide a secure and well-organized experience. The system also manages invoice and user data to ensure transparency and full functionality.

This module offers the ability to automate the reservation and payment processes, simplifying flight management and integration with external systems for payment processing and invoice generation. Additionally, it enables filtering and monitoring of data such as reservation status or available flights for a specific user.

The TravelAgency module is based on a modular architecture and uses modern technologies to ensure efficiency and easy maintenance. It includes a layered structure separating Models, Controllers, and APIs to enable secure and scalable interaction.
